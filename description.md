# Casper Ignite

Casper Ignite is a launch and trading hub that turns early-stage projects into tradeable tokens on the Casper network. It guides founders from idea to live listing, while giving investors a transparent place to discover, buy, and sell those tokens.

## Who it serves
- Founders who want to raise from the Casper community without juggling exchange listings or liquidity setup.
- Investors who want early access to new ventures with clear signals on growth, momentum, and risk.

## How founders launch
1. Connect a Casper wallet and submit the project profile: name, story, roadmap, token name, total supply, and the ownership slice the founder keeps.
2. Make a single CSPR payment that covers the platform fee and seeds liquidity so trading starts with real backing from day one.
3. The platform creates the project token, sets aside the creator’s share, and primes the rest for trading with starter pricing.
4. The project appears in the marketplace feed with its own page showing description, ownership, funding goal, market cap, investor count, and live activity.

## How trading works for investors
- Browse the feed for new and approved projects, with cards showing market cap, investors, funding goals, and recent performance.
- Connect a Casper wallet to place buy or sell orders with clear totals and status updates at each step.
- Orders follow a fair queue (best price first, earliest orders first), can fill in parts, and can be canceled while open.
- Live updates keep the buy/sell board, recent trades, balances, and confirmations in sync without manual refreshes.

## Marketplace progression
- Projects start in **Pre-Market** for early supporters willing to take on more risk.
- They move to **Approved** once they clear the growth milestone (sustained ~$100k market cap plus admin review), earning higher placement and trust badges.

## Safety, trust, and oversight
- Payments and trades come with progress indicators and shareable confirmations, so users can see when money moves and what finished.
- Built-in guards stop overselling and limit sudden price swings during a trade; if something goes wrong, the attempt is canceled and balances are restored.
- An admin monitoring view surfaces health checks, alerts, recent recovery actions, trading activity, and any projects needing attention.
- Users always see a traceable history: open orders, past trades, price progression, and wallet activity tied to each project.

## What the app experience feels like
- A hero section invites users to create a project or connect a wallet, backed by live counters for total projects, market cap, and investors.
- Tabs separate Approved and Pre-Market listings, with rich cards that highlight description, token symbol, market stats, and investor counts.
- Each project page combines the story, metrics, ownership, funding goals, buy/sell controls, and a timeline of trades so anyone can judge momentum at a glance.
- A rolling activity feed spotlights the latest launches, orders, and trades to keep the community informed in real time.
